# ETC5512: Assignment 4 - Modelling the Effect of Interventions on COVID-19 in Victoria

This repository includes the work and materials for Assignment 4 of the ETC5512 unit (Wild-caught data).

## Overview
This assignment aims to quantify the effects of two interventions—local lockdowns and face coverings—implemented in Victoria on June 30, 2020, and July 23, 2020, respectively. The analysis covers the period from June 1 to September 13, 2020. The assignment assesses the ability to navigate new data sources, combine data from different sources, and write a reproducible report.

## Data Sources

- Victoria Health Data: The primary dataset on the number of COVID-19 cases. Details on where the data was found and the justification for its appropriateness are provided in the report.

## Analysis Tasks
### **1. Data Preparation:**

- Explain the data source and justify its use.
- Determine if the dataset is observational or experimental.
- Create a codebook for the dataset.
- Identify the unit of data and unique identifiers.
- Transform the dataset for optimal analysis, if necessary.

### **2. Data Analysis:**

- Plot the number of daily cases, including intervention dates.
- Calculate and plot 7-day growth rates, including intervention dates, and interpret the results.
- Explain the relationship between growth rate and the effective transmission number (R(t)) for a non-mathematical audience.
- Estimate R(0) and changes in R(0) due to interventions using the S-E-I-R model.
- Incorporate interventions into the model.
- Solve the ordinary differential equation for the model and show the solution with an initial parameter guess.
- Use maximum likelihood estimation to fit the model and comment on the results.
- Identify and discuss limitations of the methodology.

### **3. Data Curation:**

- Comment on the 'Spreadsheets for computer consumption' in relation to the COVID-19 case data.
